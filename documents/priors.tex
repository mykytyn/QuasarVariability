\section{Priors}
\begin{itemize}
\item $a_r$: Gaussian with a mean of -1 and variance of 1
\item $\alpha$: Gaussian with a mean of -1 and variance of .25
\item $\tau_r$: Gaussian with a mean of 5 and variance of 2
\item $\beta$: Gaussian with a mean of -1 and variance of .25
\item $\delta_r$: Gaussian with a mean of 0 and variance of 1
\item $\gamma$: Gaussian with a mean of -1 and variance of .25
\item As of right now, the means have no priors
\end{itemize}
